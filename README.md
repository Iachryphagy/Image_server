# Image_server

Build a image server that

- Provides services in RESTful API
- Handles concurrent applies for image file
- Receives and recognizes TOSCA protocol
  
And build it with

- Less effort in configuring environment
- More clearity in error Handling
- A set of proxy util that (may) keeps you away from annoying network error.
  
## Note

*It is sad but the proxy thing may not always work properly, we may provide a solid solution like a mirror inside the GFW, but for now, if you find it broken, you should fix it by yourself.*
